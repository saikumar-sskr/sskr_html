        </ol>

to make the text bold, strong element is used in html like below:

form element is used for taking user responses and it also has an attribute called action which has the value of a location where the form data should be sent in.
             <form action = "https://freecatphotoapp.com/submit-cat-photo"></form>
You need to nest an input element inside the form element, which allows you to collect data from a web form in several ways, these are self closing.
To get different type of inputs, type attribute is used to create a password field, reset button or a control users to select file from their computer.
Earlier for the given url or location present in the action attribute, now has to access the data from the form's data, you must give the text field a name attribute and assign it a value to represent the data being submitted.
Placeholder text is also another attribute used in input element, to prompt users for providing the input data.
required attribute is used to make the user mandatorily fill the data in the form.
       <input type="text" name="catphotourl" placeholder="cat photo URL" required>

The default behavior of clicking a form button without any attributes submits the form to the location specified in the form's action attribute.
      <button>Submit</button>

Input and button elements are inline elements, they will appear side by side and will appear side by side.

label elements are used to help associate the text for an input element with the input element itself (especially for assistive technologies like screen readers). 
label element also makes the user click on the text to check the radio button.


The id attribute is used to identify specific HTML elements. Each id attribute's value must be unique from all other id values for the entire page.

in an element, if there are multiple attributes, then the order of attributes doesnot matter.

         <label><input id="indoor" type="radio"> Indoor</label>
          <label><input id="outdoor" type="radio"> Outdoor</label>
the above 2 piece code will give the chance to user to select both the radio buttons. To avoid this, both the radio buttons must have a name attribute with same value like below:
            <label><input id="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor"> Indoor</label>
          <label><input id="outdoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor"> Outdoor</label>

The fieldset element is used to group related inputs and labels together in a web form. fieldset elements are block-level elements, meaning that they appear on a new line.
          <fieldset>
            <label><input id="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" value="indoor"> Indoor</label>
            <label><input id="outdoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" value="outdoor"> Outdoor</label>
          </fieldset>
